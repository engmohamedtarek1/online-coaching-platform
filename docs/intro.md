## How we start building our platform

We are 4 **engineers** ~not normal people~ `(Mohamed Tarek, Mohamed Ashraf, Mohamed Elsherbiny, Mazen Tarek)` who thought about how to provide a suitable environment for remote training after the Corona pandemic period. Therefore, we decided to build an **intermediary platform** between doctors, fitness trainers and bodybuilding trainers all in one row to help the client who needs a strong training and nutritional system from professional people.
